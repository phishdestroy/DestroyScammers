## ⚖️ Legal & Privacy Position

This repository contains **public, legally collected OSINT data** about malicious actors involved in phishing, draining, impersonation, and online fraud.

### **Rules:**

* **All actors were notified in advance** and continued malicious activity knowingly.
* **Only public data** is included (domains, hosting, JS artefacts, URLScan logs, WebArchive snapshots).
* **GDPR, DMCA, and "right to be forgotten" do NOT apply** to criminal digital infrastructure.
* **No takedown requests** will be processed unless a factual inaccuracy is proven.
* Scammers become **public actors by their own actions and mistakes**, not because of this repository.
* This project **does not defame** — it documents.

## ⚔️ Final Statement

Scammers decide their own fate.

DestroyScammers does not "hunt" anyone —
Your phishing sites, your drainers, your domains, your fingerprints, and your own operational mistakes expose you.

**Actions have consequences.**
**Exposure is inevitable.**
**Justice arrives sooner or later.**

DestroyScammers is simply the mirror reflecting what you already left in public.
